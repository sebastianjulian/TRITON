description: Load feature implementation workflow and await feature request
---

I will read the FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_WORKFLOW.md file to understand the 5-step implementation process, then wait for you to describe the specific feature you want me to implement.

Reading the workflow file now to prepare for feature implementation following the established process:

**Step 1**: Reading workflow (complete)  
**Step 2**: Create detailed plan & track progress (awaiting feature description)  
**Step 3**: Final review loop (pending implementation)  
**Step 4**: Compilation & functionality verification (pending implementation)  
**Step 5**: Loop until error-free (pending implementation)  

Please describe the feature you would like me to implement, and I will follow the workflow to deliver it correctly and thoroughly.
