Questions:
    - If you want the data to be transmitted to the website, you will either have to stay nearby or provide the submarine with internet access

Documentation:
    - system architecture diagrams
    - subsystem Documentation
    - software api references
    - hardware schematics and wiring diagrams
    - FAQs
    - Github link
    - software feature update
    - hardware upgrade history

Dashboard:
    * Data Values
        - depth
        - orientation (with 3d-model)
        - GPS
        - power consumption
        - battery level
        - clock

    * Map
        - map with live location (appropriate zoom level)
        - geotagged sensor readings (where (geographically) are the min/max values)

    * Graphs
        - graphs colors (for high values red, low values blue, ...)
        - graph values prediction
        - data correlation (allows user to create graphs and to select which to values (e.g. temp vs depth) should be correlated (chosen for the axes))
 


Features:
    *Remote Control and Security: 
        - control via lora/view mode (no inputs = default) (needs a login so that not everyone can control it)
        - command logs (who issued what command when)
        - advance warning (recognise patterns which could lead to failure or future problems)
        - secure login with role based acces
        - two factor authentication for mission control
        - encrypted communication
        - ???VPN/TOR for remote access???


    * Emergency Situations
        - emergency surfacing
        - problem detection (leaks, low battery, geofence breach) with auto emergency surfacing

    * Navigation
        - inertial navigation via gyroscope (calculate distance from acceleration)
    
    * Miscellaneous
        - run files while booting
        - object recognition from images/video
    

   
  
Old:
- axes scales
- stop/resume/pause/new file buttons
